# Text Adventure Slack Bot

A slack bot that I made to run various text adventures. Currently the only completed one is the tutorial, but I also started working on a second story called Adventures with Odif. This one might take a bit to make as I am terrible at ending stories, but if you have any suggestions for how it should end, DM me (@KittyCat) on Hack Club's Slack or create an issue and put your idea there (if you aren't part of Hack Club).

Additionally, I would really appreciate other stories, so if you have or end up writing a text adventure/choose your own adventure story and want it to be part of the bot, please let me know via a DM or an issue.

## Commands/How to use:

_Note: The tutorial adventure will mainly use these slash commands (except when talking to a character), however, I'm making Adventures with Odif more text-based, meaning you won't have to use a slash command, but instead you'll type our your chosen option and send it to the bot. I'm planning on making the stories built into the bot be a mix of these two types._

* **/startadventure -** brings up a prompt asking you to choose what adventure you want to start
* **/go [direction] -** move north, south, east, or west in an adventure
* **/look -** see the room description again in an adventure
* **/talkto [npc] -** talk to a character in an adventure
* **/pickup [item] -** pick up an item in an adventure
<!-- * **/use [item] -** use an item in your inventory in an adventure -->
* **/attack [target] -** attack an enemy or target in an adventure
* **/inventory -** see what you're carrying in an adventure
